FN to Enable unlimited dropdowns in a navigation list, cause why not?

HOW TO:
  ...

TO DO:
  - make it configurable, ideally in such away that allows the choice ofs root nav, root list and dropdown elements along with their respective toggles
  - easily configurable supported events, mouseovers, or just clicks?
  - automatic positioning of dropdowns, so they don't overflow the viewport (think tooltips)
  - more flexible, as in, less dependant on html structure (use element.closest() instead of element.parentElement)
